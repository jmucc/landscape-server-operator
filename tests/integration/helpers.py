    `retries`:
        Total number of retries to allow. Takes precedence over other counts.
        Set to None to remove this constraint and fall back on other counts.
        Set to 0 to fail on the first retry.

    `backoff_factor`:
        A backoff factor to apply between attempts after the second try (most errors
        are resolved immediately by a second try without a delay). urllib3 will sleep
        for: {backoff factor} * (2 ** ({number of previous retries})) seconds.

    `status_forcelist`:
        A set of integer HTTP status codes that we should force a retry on. A retry is
        initiated if the request method is in allowed_methods and the response status
        code is in status_forcelist. By default, this is disabled with None.
